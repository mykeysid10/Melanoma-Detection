# Melanoma Detection (Skin Cancer Detection)

#### Domain: Object Detection | Computer Vision

#### Abstract:

- Melanoma is a type of skin cancer.
- It typically occurs when these cells undergo malignant transformations, resulting in the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.
- Melanoma can develop on any part of the body, including areas not exposed to the sun.
- Benign refers to a non-cancerous condition or tumor.
- In the context of skin lesions, a benign growth or lesion does not possess the characteristics of cancer.
- Benign skin lesions are generally harmless and do not pose significant health risks.
- Examples of benign skin lesions include moles, freckles, and skin tags.
